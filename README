Google Chrome extension to open mailto: links with Fastmail.

The icon is adapted from the official Fastmail logo:

	http://jhoward.fastmail.fm/logos/index.html


Before using it, you must do two things: 

First, add jquery. Save it as Mailto_Fastmail/jquery.js.

Then, create fastmail_48 and fastmail_16 icons by resizing the
fastmail_128 icon.
